## Thank you for stopping by!

Since you've come this far, I'm presuming you're interested in learning more about anything as code. I created this website to document my work and share my experiences with others, in the hopes that it would be useful to others.

If you'd like to connect, please contact me via LinkedIn or the email address shown in the [contact](#Contact) section below.

### What should you anticipate from this site?
This website was intended to give resources and tutorials relating to DevOps, GitOps, Cloud Automation with Infrastructure as Code, and a approach for automating anything in the cloud with code.
Gitops and cloud infrastructure automation are at the heart of anything as code.
GitOps is built around the developer experience and helps teams manage infrastructure using the same tools and processes they use for software development.

Let's set aside the theory and industrial jargon and concentrate on solutions that can assist in the automation. In the interests of assisting others, I'll give real-world examples and some of the tools I created to make my life easier.

In the left sidebar, there is a **Tutorials & Articles** button where you may find some of my work. There aren't many yet, but I'm working on increasing the number. Because I generally worked with businesses, the majority of my work is client proprietary, however I am aiming to work on opensource projects that will be published as soon as they are completed.


## Projects
